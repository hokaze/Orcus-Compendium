At least four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Other participants must provide the dialogue for other characters in the epic of Hrothgar. Then the flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.  \n\nBecause the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside quickly gets stiflingly hot. Any creature inside the hut must make an Endure check (DC 20) every 10 minutes or suffer the effects of severe heat (lose a recovery).  \n\nJust as the tale of Hrothgar approaches its conclusion (near the end of the casting time), the bonfire\u2019s flames light the hut on fire, which creates a great deal of smoke but no additional heat or damage. The flames consume the hut\u2019s roof and walls, revealing Valhalla. If the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Arcana check, they can choose the exact location in Valhalla that the party appears.  \n\n<figure><img src=\"pics\\LuigiCastellani_LOKOSSAPALACE.png\" alt=\"Palace by Luigi Castellani\" style=\"zoom: 100%;\" /><figcaption>Palace by Luigi Castellani</figcaption></figure>"

An animal that doesn\u2019t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.\n* Fetch: The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.\n* Guard: The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.\n* Heel: The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn\u2019t go.\n* Perform: The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.\n* Seek: The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.\n* Stay: The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.\n* Track: The animal tracks the scent presented to it. \n* Work: The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load."

The spirit doesn\u2019t remember anything that happened more than 1 day ago.\n\nIf you fail, the spirit doesn\u2019t answer you. If you fail by 10 or more, the spirit is wracked with misery or bewilderment and gives you an erroneous answer."

While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.\n\nThe geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.\n\nIf the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the craft remains in effect for a maximum of one day per level you have. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.\n\nIf the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas* for 24 hours, it loses one recovery. It cannot regain this recovery while the geas remains.\n\n**Religion check:** With a moderate DC Religion check (based on the level of the target), you can target a creature of level higher than your own.

This rift brings about a massive conflagration that destroys almost everything in the immediate area, then releases a powerful demon who capers over the smoldering ruins and begins to rampage across the countryside. The *fires of the Abyss* ignite everything they touch\u2014except for the caster, who is knocked unconscious and transported to a layer of the Abyss.  \n\nWhen the incantation is complete, the *fires of the Abyss* erupt from the caster\u2019s former location.\n\n*Attack:* Near burst 16; +26 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target takes 18d6 fire damage. On a miss, the target takes half damage. Either way, everything flammable in the burst is lit on fire.  \n\n*Secondary Effect:* At initiative count 20 on the following round, a balor comes through the rift, which then closes. The balor begins to destroy everything in sight."
