Chapter,0,,,Arcana,,,,,
Alarm,1,Abjuration,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire (14 gp),14 gp,8 hours,"You ward an area in a two-square burst to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast *alarm*, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the incantation’s area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell. Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against your Arcana modifier +10 or trigger the incantation when moving into the area.

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can specify criteria for which creatures sound the *alarm* - for instance, orcs or masked people."
Floating Disk,1,Crafting,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A drop of mercury (14 gp)  ,14 gp,1 hour,"This incantation creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied square of your choice that you can see. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the incantation ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  

The disk is immobile while you are within 4 squares of it. If you move more than 4 squares away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 4 squares of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 2 squares or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 2-square deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  

If you move more than 20 squares from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the incantation ends.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can give the floating disk a simple instruction. It can be further than 20 squares away from you while fulfilling the instruction. "
Identify,1,Divination,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A pearl (28 gp),14 gp,Instantaneous,"You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the incantation. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any magical effects are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by an art or power, you learn which art or power created it.  

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what magical effects, if any, are currently affecting it. 

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you have one additional question about the item or creature answered - like its age, provenance or creator."
Illusory Script,1,Illusion,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A lead-based ink (14 gp),14 gp,10 days,"You hide a message on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material.  

To you and any creatures familiar with your technique, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown script that is unintelligible. 

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can instead can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  "
Mage’s Mark,1,Transmutation,Incantation,Arcana,1 minute,Fresh candle and silver stylus (14 gp),14 gp,Permanent,"Every mage has their own mark, usually an elaborate and unique rune. This ritual allows a mage to inscribe their mark on any non-magical substance, including stone and metal. The rune remains permanently upon the surface, only disappearing if the item or surface itself is destroyed. The mage may choose to make this mark visible to all, or only to those with the sight (meaning that most folk will not be able to see it at all, but anyone with Arcana training will see it)."
Understand Languages,1,Divination,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A pinch of soot and salt and an amethyst (14 gp),14 gp,1 hour,"For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.  

This incantation doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can also speak any spoken language you have heard during the duration. "
Unseen Servant,1,Conjuration,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,"A piece of string, a bit of wood and a glass bauble (14 gp)",14 gp,8 hours,"This incantation creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the incantation ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the incantation ends.  

Once on each of your turns as a swift action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 squares and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.  

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 12 squares away from you, the incantation ends.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, the duration extends to 24 hours and the incantation does not end if the servant moves more than 12 squares away from you. "
Perpetual Message,3,Illusion,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust (54 gp),27 gp,Permanent,"You implant a message within an object within 6 squares, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the incantation to deliver your message.  

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. After it delivers the message, the *magic mouth* incantation ends.  

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 6 squares of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 6 squares of the object or when a silver bell rings within 6 squares of it.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 14) at the time of casting, you can choose for the incantation to not end after it delivers its message, but instead for it to remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs. "
Sphere of Silence,3,Illusion,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,27 gp,27 gp,8 hours,"For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 4-square burst centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a incantation is impossible there.  

**Arcana check:** With a successful Arcana check (DC 14) at the time of casting, the target can be an object or creature instead of a point. The burst of silence moves with the object or creature."
Continual Flame,5,Crafting,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,Ruby dust (80 gp),40 gp,Instantaneous,"A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.  "
Dismiss Magic,5,Practical,Incantation,Arcana,1 minute,72 gp,72 gp,Instantaneous,"Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within 24 squares. Any incantation or non-martial power of 5th level or lower on the target ends. For each incantation or non-martial power of 6th level or higher (or no level) on the target, make an Arcana check. The DC equals 10 + the incantation or power’s level. On a successful check, the effect ends.

Alternatively, a magic item you touch becomes non-magical for the next 10 minutes.

**Arcana check:** You can instead choose a magic item within 24 squares to become non-magical for 10 minutes, but you must succeed on an Arcana check vs the wielder’s Will (if it has a wielder). "
Liquid Tread,5,Transportation,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A piece of cork and 40 gp,40 gp,8 hours,"This incantation grants one target the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). 

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the incantation carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 12 squares per round.  

**Arcana check:** With a DC 15 Arcana check, you can choose up to 10 targets for this incantation."
Meld into Stone,5,Practical,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,40 gp,40 gp,8 hours,"You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.  

State a trigger. When that trigger is satisfied you are expelled from the stone and the incantation ends. Otherwise, you must wait for the 8 hour duration to end. 

While merged with the stone, you can hear but not see what occurs outside it. You remain aware of the passage of time while merged in the stone. 

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.  

**Arcana check:** If you succeed on a DC 15 Arcana check at the time of casting, while melded in stone you can use your movement to leave the stone whenever you want, instead of waiting for the trigger. You leave the stone from where you entered it, and doing so ends the incantation. "
Sorcerous Gills,5,Practical,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,"A short reed or piece of straw, and 40 gp",40 gp,24 hours,"This incantation grants a willing creature the ability to breathe underwater until the incantation ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.   

**Arcana check:** With a DC 15 Arcana check, you can choose up to 10 targets for this incantation."
Spectral Steed,5,Crafting,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,40 gp,40 gp,8 hours,"A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the incantation vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 2 squares away from the steed.  

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 20 squares and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the incantation ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The incantation ends if you use a swift action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage. 

**Arcana check:** With a DC 15 Arcana check, the steed can also walk on water as if the *liquid tread* incantation had been used on it. With higher Arcana check DCs, the steed may have other movement abilities like the ability to phase through objects or to fly (with a maximum altitude, or without a maximum altitude with an even higher DC). "
Tiny Hut,5,Crafting,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A small crystal bead (40 gp),40 gp,8 hours,"An immobile dome of force springs into existence in a 2-square burst around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The incantation ends if you leave its area.  

The incantation fails if its edge intersects a creature. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this incantation can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.  

Until the incantation ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.  

**Arcana check:** With a DC 15 Arcana check, the dome’s burst radius is 4 squares instead of 2. "
Contact Other Plane,9,Divination,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,168 gp,168 gp,1 minute,"You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this incantation, make a DC 19 Arcana check. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are overawed until you finish a long rest. While overawed, you can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A *restoration* art used on you ends this effect.  

On a successful check, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer. "
Call Forth the Dweller,11,Divination,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,Forty-two mystic symbols inscribed around the perimeter of the target doorway (requiring materials costing 360 gp),360 gp,8 hours,"This incantation contacts the enigmatic, extradimensional being known as the Dweller on the Threshold, an entity that imparts knowledge about its specific obsession: doors and other entrances.  

To cast *call forth the Dweller*, the caster must inscribe forty-two mystic symbols around an open doorway, then begin the chants and supplications required for the incantation.  

If the incantation succeeds, an image of the Dweller—an inky mass of tentacles and mouths—appears on the other side of the doorway. The Dweller on the Threshold truthfully answers any questions it is asked about a particular door. For example, the Dweller can provide a magical password that unlocks a door, indicate how to disarm a trap on a door, reveal the weaknesses of a door’s guardian, or describe the room that lies beyond the door. Its answers are clear and fairly specific, if somewhat terse. The caster may well appreciate such concise answers, because one of the forty-two symbols inscribed around the doorway during the casting of the incantation fades away with each word the Dweller on the Threshold speaks—and when all the symbols are gone, the Dweller disappears.  

If the caster asks the Dweller on the Threshold a question that doesn’t involve doors, the Dweller responds with a cutting insult, often about something the caster thought was secret. Each word of the insult likewise makes a symbol disappear from the perimeter of the doorway.  

The exact nature of the Dweller on the Threshold is shrouded in mystery."
Hrothgar’s Journey,11,Transportation,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,"A windowless, thatched hut in a forest (360 gp)",360 gp,Instantaneous,"*Hrothgar’s journey* is an incantation based on the tale of Hrothgar, a powerful barbarian hero from ages past. When the poetic epic of Hrothgar is recited in the stifling heat of a sweat lodge during the winter solstice, the orator and his listeners receive the same final reward that Hrothgar did: a one-way trip to Asgard’s Valhalla, where they can drink and make merry with the greatest warriors of myth.  

To cast the incantation, the caster must construct a small, windowless hut in the middle of the forest, then build a bonfire in the hut’s center. At least four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Other participants must provide the dialogue for other characters in the epic of Hrothgar. Then the flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.  

Because the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside quickly gets stiflingly hot. Any creature inside the hut must make an Endure check (DC 20) every 10 minutes or suffer the effects of severe heat (lose a recovery).  

Just as the tale of Hrothgar approaches its conclusion (near the end of the casting time), the bonfire’s flames light the hut on fire, which creates a great deal of smoke but no additional heat or damage. The flames consume the hut’s roof and walls, revealing Valhalla. If the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Arcana check, they can choose the exact location in Valhalla that the party appears.

Summon Item,11,Conjuration,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,A sapphire (720 gp),360 gp,Permanent,"You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The incantation leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this incantation, you must use a different sapphire.  

At any time thereafter, you can use your standard action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the incantation ends.  

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.  

*Dismiss magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this incantation’s effect. 

**Arcana check:** With an Arcana check, the object can weigh more than 10 pounds (the number of pounds is the DC of the Arcana check). "
Telepathic Bond,11,Divination,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,"Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures, one rare (360 gp)",360 gp,8 hours,"You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice in the area, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this incantation.  

Until the incantation ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.  

**Arcana check:** With a DC 19 Arcana check, the duration is 1 week. "
Plane Walk,13,Transportation,Incantation,Arcana,1 hour,"A forked, metal rod (680 gp), attuned to a particular plane of existence",680 gp,Instantaneous,"You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, and you appear in or near that destination.   

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this incantation can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  

**Arcana check:** With a DC 28 Arcana check, you appear in the exact place you specify on the plane. "
Moving Castle,21,Practical,Incantation,Arcana,24 hours,"18,000 gp","9,000 gp",Permanent,"Select a dwelling somewhere between a hut and a small castle in size. The dwelling lifts itself off the ground and grows one of the following means of transport:   

* **Levitation:** The dwelling floats over the ground and over water, giving it fly 6 (hover, maximum altitude 2).  
* **Chicken Legs:** The dwelling runs along the ground, giving it speed 12.    
* **Rollers:** The dwelling moves on treads on the ground, giving it speed 8 - but it ignores difficult, obstructing and other terrain.   

The dwelling follows your spoken instructions if they are given from within or just outside the dwelling, about as faithfully as a dim but well-meaning dog might.   "
Chapter,0,,,Athletics,,,,,

Chapter,0,,,Bluff,,,,,
Teach Cant,1,Lesson,Practice,Bluff,1 week,28 gp,14 gp,Instantaneous,"The subject of a *teach cant* lesson learns the cant used by thieves, urchins and demi-mondaines. A character who learns this art learns cant along with it, if they did not already know it."
Backup Disguise,2,Trick,Practice,Bluff,10 minutes,21 gp,21 gp,Until your next long rest,"You prepare a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise as a standard action. Having a backup disguise doesn’t allow you to remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready, it’s possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements of the disguise."
Use Magic Device,2,Trick,Practice,Bluff,*,1 recovery,21 gp,Instantaneous,"You use a magic item or other magical device even if you do not meet the prerequisites to do so. You must succeed on a Bluff check (easy DC based on the level of the magic item or device) in order to do so. If you fail, there may be negative consequences depending on the item or device. The completion time is double the normal time it takes to activate the item. "
Hidden Magic,6,Trick,Practice,Bluff,10 minutes,72 gp,72 gp,1 year,"You carefully tweak a magic item to appear non-magical according to incantations, powers and skills that observe magical auras."
Social Identity,6,Trick,Practice,Bluff,1 week,"144 gp of bribes, materials, etc.",72 gp,Instantaneous,"You create a social identity, with its own name, alignment, and abilities. This identity is not a false front; you really are your social identity as well as your original identity, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other. 

Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don’t reduce the time required to change identities.

Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity’s alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as an artifact that only respects good characters) only if both of your identities qualify. Researching one of your identities don’t reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the research knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn’t exist."
Nameless One,15,Trick,Practice,Bluff,1 week,"1,000 gp","1,000 gp",Instantaneous,"You eschew all of your former identities, going as far as to render your former name completely inaccessible to discover by mortal means. After this practice, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you. You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. 

At the art’s conclusion, you must don the mask created for the art, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you’re wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist."

Dealmaker,5,Interaction,Practice,Diplomacy,1 hour,1 recovery,40 gp,Instantaneous,"You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. When looking to buy or sell an item that would normally be outside that available for sale or purchase in the local community, make a Diplomacy check (DC depends on the level of the item and the size of the community). On a success, you’re able to sell or purchase that item. "
Entourage,7,Interaction,Practice,Diplomacy,1 week,208 gp,104 gp,Instantaneous,"You have a small group of admirers who tend to follow you around while you’re in civilized settlements. Your admirers are helpful to you, allowing you to make simple requests of them such as purchasing basic equipment with your funds or finding a room at an inn.

Biographical Eye,5,Information,Practice,Insight,1 minute,1 recovery,40 gp,Instantaneous,"In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person’s origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person’s fingernails and determine they’re an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn’t learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.

Spend 1 minute, then attempt an Insight check. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your Insight check exceeds their Bluff check.

The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day.

Teach Trick,1,Lesson,Practice,Nature,1 week,*,14 gp,Instantaneous,"Animals and other unintelligent creatures can be taught a trick using this method. The component cost equals the cost of a consumable item of the creature’s level. An animal can be taught multiple tricks over the week, but multiply the component cost by the number of tricks taught. 

* Attack: The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) takes twice as long.
* Come: The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.
* Defend: The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.
* Down: The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
* Fetch: The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.

* Track: The animal tracks the scent presented to it. 
* Work: The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load."
Spirit Speaker,2,Divination,Incantation,Nature,10 minutes,Incense (21 gp),21 gp,1 minute,"When an animal dies, its spirit lingers briefly before moving on. Using low chants, body language that shows respect, and special movements that demonstrate to the spirit that you are an ally, you glean information from a spirit before it departs. You ask one simple question of the spirit. Attempt a Nature check at a DC determined by the GM (normally, this is the appropriate DC for the level of the animal or beast when it was alive). Regardless of the result of your check, the spirit immediately departs and can’t be used for Spirit Speaker again. 

If you succeed, the spirit answers you truthfully. The spirit’s answer is likely to be terse or cryptic compared to normal communication with an animal, and it can pertain only to things the creature directly experienced or considered important. The spirit doesn’t remember anything that happened more than 1 day ago.

If you fail, the spirit doesn’t answer you. If you fail by 10 or more, the spirit is wracked with misery or bewilderment and gives you an erroneous answer."

You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired gnome wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the incantation toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.  

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the incantation ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this incantation.  

**Nature check:** The duration of the incantation is your Nature check result in hours.   "

You can question plants about events within 6 squares within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.  

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.  

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The incantation doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.  

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.  "

Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to enact a brilliant plan, withdrawing an item that would have been available in a settlement you visited or procuring a mundane service that your character planned ahead of time. Once you enact the plan, subtract the price of the item or service from the fund. Any item procured must weigh 10 pounds or less. Likewise, the GM must approve any non-magical service you gain by using your fund as being appropriate for the location selected.

Witness an Oath,1,Practical,Incantation,Religion,1 hour,1 recovery,14 gp,Instantaneous,"You swear an oath or bear witness to one sworn by another. 

To swear an oath, the subject names—very specifically—a task they will accomplish in no more than one year’s time. If the task is not completed in that time, or if conditions arise that indicate the failure of the oath, they lose all recoveries, and cannot regain them for a month. 

The oath-swearer cannot be tricked into thinking an oath is fulfilled when it is not, and no magical compulsion can force them to stop attempting to fulfill it. 

Oaths can be singular tasks (destroy the Dark Tower) or ongoing (keep King Dari alive). Ongoing oaths can be renewed at the end of each year. An oath must be something measurable, so the character knows whether it has been fulfilled. 

The oath-swearer receive a +2 power bonus on skill checks while working towards their oath, and a +2 power bonus to defenses against attacks that would directly stop them from working towards their oath."

Remove Curse,5,Curative,Incantation,Religion,1 hour,80 gp,40 gp,Instantaneous,"At your touch, all curses of your level or lower (or no level) affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the incantation breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

Until the incantation ends, you can ask the corpse a question. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This incantation doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.  

Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge.

**Religion check:** With a DC 18 Religion check, you contact a more powerful entity aligned strongly with your interests, possibly even your deity. The entity won’t attempt to deceive you, though it still might not know the answers.

For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals to enter the area. The incantation proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Plane of Faerie, Plane of Shadow, or the *plane walk* incantation.  

In addition, the incantation damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following tags: air, celestial, cold, demon, devil, earth, fire, water or undead. When a creature with that tag enters the incantation’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this incantation).  

When you cast this incantation, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the incantation.  

The incantation’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbid intrusion* incantation. If you cast *forbid intrusion* every day for 7 days in the same location, the incantation lasts until it is dispelled.  "

The creature must be of your level or lower and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the craft remains in effect for a maximum of one day per level you have. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas* for 24 hours, it loses one recovery. It cannot regain this recovery while the geas remains.

This rift brings about a massive conflagration that destroys almost everything in the immediate area, then releases a powerful demon who capers over the smoldering ruins and begins to rampage across the countryside. The *fires of the Abyss* ignite everything they touch—except for the caster, who is knocked unconscious and transported to a layer of the Abyss.  

When the incantation is complete, the *fires of the Abyss* erupt from the caster’s former location.

*Attack:* Near burst 16; +26 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target takes 18d6 fire damage. On a miss, the target takes half damage. Either way, everything flammable in the burst is lit on fire.  

*Secondary Effect:* At initiative count 20 on the following round, a balor comes through the rift, which then closes. The balor begins to destroy everything in sight."

If you carouse with another creature in this way, you can attempt to learn secrets from it by drinking it under the table. Each hour you spend carousing with a willing creature, make an Endure check vs the target’s Fortitude.

Shady Connections,2,Interaction,Practice,Streetsmarts,1 hour,21 gp,21 gp,Instantaneous,"You have dealings with a variety of unsavory characters, which you can leverage to trade favors or meet powerful people.

If the subject of your rumor is not currently the subject of any contradictory rumors, this typically takes 2 hours, at the end of which you make a Streetsmarts check to see how well you spread the rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the subject, it takes less time to spread the rumor, and if you are attempting to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor, it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor is. If you succeed, you successfully spread the rumor. If you fail, your rumor dies off.
