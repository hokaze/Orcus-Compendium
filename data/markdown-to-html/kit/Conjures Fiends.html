<h2>Conjures Fiends</h2>
<p>You summon fiends from the depths of Hell.  </p>
<p><strong>Enduring Summons (Level 1):</strong> When you use a daily Summon power, the summoned creature immediately gets to take an action of the same type as the type you used to summon them (for example, if you use <em>prestige binding</em>, a standard action, the big burner you summon can immediately use a standard action).   </p>
<p><strong>Far Call (Level 5):</strong> Increase the range of powers with the Summon tag that you use by 9. For most Cup of Brimstone Summon powers, this means they are now Ranged 10.  </p>
<p><strong>Careful Contract (Level 10):</strong> You do not lose a recovery when your summoned creature is reduced to 0 HP. </p>
<p><strong>Associated Discipline:</strong> Cup of Brimstone.  </p>
