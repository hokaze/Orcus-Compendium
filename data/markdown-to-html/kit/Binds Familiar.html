<h2>Binds Familiar</h2>
<p>You have bound to your service a familiar, a Tiny animal or creature that aids you and provides companionship.   </p>
<p><strong>Spirit Friend (Level 1):</strong> You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose (from the list below). You also get the benefit listed in the “Constant Benefit” column. </p>
<p>The familiar follows the Companion rules, as well as the following special rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are incapacitated or not present, your familiar gets its full complement of actions without needing to be “commanded”.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The familiar’s maximum HP are equal to your recovery value. </p>
</li>
<li>Your familiar uses your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.   </li>
<li>When your familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You lose one recovery or, if not able to lose a recovery, take damage equal to your recovery value. Your familiar reappears after your next long rest, at full HP. </li>
<li>While your familiar is within 20 squares of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.  </li>
<li>The familiar is of human-like intelligence, although it may think very differently to humanoids or not be communicative.   </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hidden Away/Called</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>As a swift action, your familiar can hide away on your person, which may involve disappearing in a puff of smoke until you call them again, or turning into a tattoo on your arm or a statuette in your pocket, or simply slipping into your pocket. While hidden away, it cannot act, but it also cannot be targeted by any effect, does not take damage, etc.   </li>
<li>You can call a hidden away familiar as a swift action. It appears in a square adjacent to you.   </li>
<li>While called, the familiar gives you the benefit listed in the “While Called” column.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat Assistant (Level 5):</strong> Your familiar gets a +1 bonus to all defenses.   </p>
<p>While your familiar is hidden away, you get a +1 bonus to Reflex defense.  </p>
<p>While your familiar is called, you get a +1 bonus on attack rolls against enemies adjacent to or in the same space as your familiar.   </p>
<p><strong>Speedy Summons (Level 10):</strong> Your familiar gets a further +1 bonus to all defenses.   </p>
<p>Your familiar reappears after your next short rest if it drops to 0 hit points.   </p>
