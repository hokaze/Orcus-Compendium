<p>Your strengths are not in your endurance, speed, or ability to strike something with pinpoint accuracy. You use a part of the body most of your comrades seem to let rot, your brain. You understand that you may be on the border between genius and madness, but all the great minds of the world balance that knife-edge.</p>
