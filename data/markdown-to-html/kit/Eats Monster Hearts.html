<h2>Eats Monster Hearts</h2>
<p>You have a mystical connection to monsters, and can steal a measure of their supernatural power from their bodies. </p>
<p><strong>Consume Strength (Level 1):</strong> After an encounter in which you defeated a monster, you can replace one of your encounter attack powers with an at-will attack power of the monster’s. The power is an encounter power for you.  The encounter power you replace must be of a level equal to or greater than the monster’s level.</p>
<p>You can instead or also replace one of your daily attack powers with an encounter or refresh attack power of the monster’s. The power is a daily power for you.  The daily power you replace must be of a level equal to or greater than the monster’s level.</p>
<p>If the daily power you replaced had already been expended, you must wait until after your next long rest before using the new power acquired from the monster.</p>
<p>Powers you gain through this feature have the Focus tag and use the ability score of your choice for the attack. </p>
<p>After each long rest, roll 1d6 for each monster power you used that day. On a 1, you lose that monster power. Alternatively, you can choose to lose a monster power after any short or long rest. However you lose the power, it is replaced with the encounter or daily attack power you originally replaced it with. </p>
<p><strong>Level 5:</strong> After an encounter in which you defeated a monster, you can replace one of your utility powers with a non-attack power, movement speed, resistance, immunity or sense of the monster’s. The utility power you replace must be of a level equal to or greater than the monster’s level.</p>
<p>If the monster could use the power at-will or it was always active, your utility power is an encounter power that lasts until the end of your next round or a daily power
that lasts until the end of the encounter (your choice). If the monster could use the power once per encounter or on a refresh basis, your utility power is a daily power. </p>
<p>After each long rest, roll 1d6 for each monster power you used that day. On a 1, you lose that monster power. Alternatively, you can choose to lose a monster power after any short or long rest. However you lose the power, it is replaced with the utility power you originally replaced it with.  </p>
<p><strong>Level 10:</strong> After an encounter in which you defeated a monster of your level or lower, you can gain an aura of the monster. You can only have one such aura active at any one time. </p>
<p>In addition, you do not need to defeat a monster to use your Level 1, 5 or 10 features. The monster can willingly grant you the power(s) instead. </p>
