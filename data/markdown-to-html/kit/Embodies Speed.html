<h2>Embodies Speed</h2>
<p>With unmatched physical discipline, you have perfected a body designed for raw speed and agility. It’s not enough just to be athletic: you have to keep your eyes and mind sharp, to gauge distances, crawlspaces, and the shortest possible route even if it involves some death-defying feat of acrobatic skill. You can keep an entire landscape in mind, analyzing paths and routes of escape, even when everyone else just sees walls.</p>
<p><strong>Power To Weight Ratio (Level 1):</strong>  You can use Dexterity in place of Strength for Athletics checks when performing a climb or a jump. You can also use Dexterity in place of Strength for attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks, one-handed melee weapons, and grapples.  </p>
<p>You do not grant combat advantage while balancing.  </p>
<p><strong>Speed Vault (Level 5):</strong> If you move at least 2 squares while running toward a wall, you gain a climb speed equal to your remaining movement. If you have not cleared the wall by the end of your movement, you must make an Athletics check to climb normally.  </p>
<p><strong>Split-Slide (Level 10):</strong> Once per round, as a swift action, you can select one enemy in line of sight. You do not provoke opportunity attacks from that enemy and can pass through the enemy’s square as if it wasn’t occupied. You cannot end your movement in the square.  </p>
<p><strong>Associated Discipline:</strong> Born to Run.  </p>
