<h2>Embodies Charisma</h2>
<p>You have always displayed confidence in the way you talk and present yourself. You’re also clever enough to know what to say at the right times to have the greatest effect. You know that how you speak means more than the words themselves.  </p>
<p><strong>Commanding Presence (Level 1):</strong> Choose one of the following auras at character generation. Once per day, you can activate an aura as a swift action, which lasts until the end of the encounter, unless you end it as a swift action or you fall unconscious.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>By Example</strong> aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 power bonus to Fortitude defense and Will defense.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Field Advice</strong> aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws except death saves and saves against unconsciousness.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mask of Authority</strong> aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 power bonus to damage rolls with basic attacks. <em>Level 11:</em> +3 power bonus. <em>Level 21:</em> +4 power bonus.   </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Stand as One</strong> aura 2; whenever an ally in the aura regains hit points, they regain additional hit points equal to your Charisma or Intelligence modifier. In addition, the action required for rally is reduced from standard to move, or from move to swift. <em>Level 11:</em> Additional hit points equal to 4 + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier <em>Level 21:</em> Additional hit points equal to 8 + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier  </li>

<p><strong>People’s Hero (Level 5):</strong> As a swift action, you can spend a recovery, but regain no hit points; instead, you extend any Command Presence auras you have in effect by a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn.  </p>
<p><strong>Presence of Leadership (Level 10):</strong> When you use the Rally action, one ally in your aura can spend a recovery to heal damage equal to their recovery value.  </p>
