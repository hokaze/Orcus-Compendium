<h2>Ruler of Shadows</h2>
<p>You are recognized by every brigand and cutpurse, every sneakthief and bandit. Cat burglars are your courtiers; extortionists your earls. The darkness is your cloak and crown.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Trusty Action (11th level):</strong> When you use an action point to take an extra action, the action always succeeds (you pass your skill check or at least one attack roll in an attack no matter your roll, for example). If you would fail, you succeed but there’s a side-effect or “sting in the tail” – like a tremendous success drawing unwanted attention or a desperate lunge slaying your enemy but leaving you open to their allies.   </p>
<p><strong>Do As I Do (11th level):</strong> When you make a skill check, allies gain a +2 power bonus to the same skill until the beginning of your next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>The Cloak is My Shadow (16th level):</strong> You do not grant combat advantage from being flanked.   </p>
