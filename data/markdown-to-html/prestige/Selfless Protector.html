<h2>Selfless Protector</h2>
<p>You possess a natural instinct to protect whoever is assigned to you. You may never have taken an arrow but likely neither has your target. You can spot threats from miles away and can act to move your ward to a better position if that threat gets too close.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Take a Hit (11th level):</strong> As a swift action, select one adjacent creature to be your focus. You can only have one focus at a time. Until the end of the encounter or until you change focus, as long as your focus does not attack and remains adjacent to you, they can use your AC and Reflex defense if it is higher than theirs. If your focus is hit by an attack against AC or Reflex, you take the damage instead. When you move, you shunt your focus with you.  </p>
<p><strong>Total Cover (11th level):</strong> When you spend an action point, both you and your focus gain a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex defense until the end of your next turn and you can shift together 4 squares, instead of taking an extra action.  </p>
<p><strong>Keep it Together (16th level):</strong> Each time you regain hit points, you can give your focus any or all of the hit points instead.  </p>
