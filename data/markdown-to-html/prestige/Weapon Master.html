<p><strong>Pincer Attack (11th level):</strong> Instead of spending an action point to take an additional action, you can spend it to use two at-will attack powers that require a standard action, one after the other. They do not have to have the same target.  </p>
<p><strong>Careful Opportunist (16th level):</strong> When a creature provokes an opportunity attack, you can use an at-will attack power instead of making a basic attack. You must make a melee attack.  </p>
