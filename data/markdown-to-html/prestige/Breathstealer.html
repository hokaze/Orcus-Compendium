<h2>Breathstealer</h2>
<p>You are a silent, cold, calculating assassin. Your skills involve intimate kills, forcing to be close to your enemy. You rise from nowhere and eliminate opponents before others can notice or respond. Crossbows and knives, even when they’re most quiet, still make a noise you would prefer to avoid.  </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Proficiency with garrote.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Out of Nowhere (11th level):</strong> You can spend an action point on a surprise round if you are granted one. If you spend an action point on your first turn in an encounter, you gain one standard action and one move action (in either order).  </p>
<p><strong>Complete Control (11th level):</strong> If you have grappled a target with a garrote, you can shunt the target 1 square or render the target prone without having to roll to sustain the grapple.  </p>
<p><strong>Special Technique (16th level):</strong> Your proficiency bonus with the garrote increases by +2. The damage die increases by two steps (from 1d4 to 1d8).  </p>
