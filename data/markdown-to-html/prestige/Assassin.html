<h2>Assassin</h2>
<p>Someone hands you an image, an address, or just a name. You move in quickly and quietly, eliminating defenses that lay in your path. You dispatch the enemy efficiently and vanish into the shadows, leaving onlookers wondering who ordered the hit and why.  </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Proficiency with simple melee and ranged weapons.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Twice in the Chest (11th level):</strong> Spend an action point to add your basic melee attack damage to your last hit with any one-handed melee weapon, instead of taking an extra action.  </p>
<p><strong>Once in the Head (11th level):</strong> You can score a critical hit with any one-handed weapon on a natural roll of 19 or 20.  </p>
<p><strong>Getaway (16th level):</strong> Each time you stagger a target with a one-handed weapon, you may shift a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier as a free action.</p>
