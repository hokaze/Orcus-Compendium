<h2>Silver Tongue</h2>
<p>You’re the one brought in when weapons cannot be used, when even the brandishing of blades is considered a total failure. You cannot give the appearance of aggression, not even when the situation goes out of control. You’re the wave of the future, where words will solve disputes, not weapons.  </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Trained in Diplomacy.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>The Art of Compromise (11th level):</strong> Gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy.  </p>
<p><strong>I Think We Got Off On The Wrong Foot (11th level):</strong> When you fail a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, you can spend an action point to add a +10 bonus to your check and reassess the outcome with this new total.  You do not gain an extra action when you use an action point this way.</p>
