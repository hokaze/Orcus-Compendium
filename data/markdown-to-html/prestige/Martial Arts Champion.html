<h2>Martial Arts Champion</h2>
<p>Surrounded on all sides, armed with little more than your iron will, you’ve stood your ground and defeated whatever lies ahead. They can have knives, crossbows, or broadswords; it’s all meaningless to you.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Carry Through (11th level):</strong> Once per round, after one of your melee attacks does one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scores a critical hit; or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staggers a target; or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drops a target </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You immediately deal damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is higher) to one target in reach.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Idea (11th level):</strong> You can spend an action point to make a melee basic attack against each adjacent target, instead of taking an extra action.  </p>
<p><strong>Unstoppable Momentum (16th level):</strong> If you inflict any of the following conditions on a target – dazed, slowed, stunned, or weakened – one creature in an adjacent square to the initial target suffers the same condition until the start of your next turn.  </p>
