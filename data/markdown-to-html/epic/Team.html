<h2>Team</h2>
<p>It has never been about personal glory or selfish ideals. From the beginning, you have stood tall among others you have treated as equals, others that have returned that honor a hundred times over. You have all lost count how many engagements you have shared, the taken bullets, the close calls. It was always, and will always be, about the team. It’s been years or even decades and none of you will quit until the others do. You each push to be the best and as a result, you all are.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Team Support (21st level):</strong> Each time you spend a recovery for any purpose, choose one ally within line of sight. The ally immediately saves against one effect a save can end (except dying). </p>
<p><strong>Where the Need is Greatest (24th level):</strong> As a swift action, choose an ally (or yourself). The target loses one recovery. If you do so, choose an ally (or yourself). The target gains one recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Brothers and Sisters of Blood (30th level):</strong> For every epic-tier ally in line of sight, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to all skill checks and damage rolls (maximum +4).  </p>
