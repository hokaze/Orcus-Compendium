<h2>Most Dangerous</h2>
<p>No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost. Enemies and allies don’t have just one nickname for you; there are several. Few are aware of all your accomplishments. Most of these victories were erased or never directly connected to you. Others you must deny. You career might never have existed at all. Missions that you took were probably illegal, extremely difficult, with no room for failure. Your handle or moniker labels you as one of the most wanted individuals on the planet.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Second Nature (21st level):</strong> You reroll natural 1s and 2s on attack rolls and skill checks, but you must take the second result even if it is another 1 or a 2.  </p>
