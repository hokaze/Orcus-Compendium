<h2>Agent Retriever</h2>
<p>Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets – they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need.   </p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price.   </p>
<h3>Immortality</h3>
<p>When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility.   </p>
<p><strong>Corner of the World’s Eye:</strong> You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane.   </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Appropriation (Level 21):</strong> Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest.   </p>
<p>The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature’s possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day.   </p>
<p><strong>Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):</strong> Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you can make basic attacks and you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.    </p>
<p>When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in.   </p>
<p><strong>The Economic Flow (Level 30):</strong> You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) – it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.  </p>
