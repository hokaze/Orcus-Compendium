<h2>Ultimate</h2>
<p>As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. In the old age, you would have been given freedom by the Caesar or awarded a lordship and a manor for your deeds. You have the blood of kings. History is written by the winners and you have seldom seen defeat.  </p>
<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p><strong>Why Won’t You Die? (21st level):</strong> Attacks cannot score critical hits against you (take normal damage).  </p>
<p><strong>Glory of the Fight (24th level):</strong> If you kill a non-mook enemy, you gain a +4 power bonus on your next attack roll. </p>
<p><strong>Risky Maneuver (30th level):</strong> As a swift action, you can reduce all your defense values to 1 until the start of your next turn. On your next turn, the first attack you make is an automatic critical hit. </p>
