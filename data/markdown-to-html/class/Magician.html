<p>You can choose powers from your class disciplines. When you do so, you can replace any reference to the discipline&#39;s key ability with Intelligence instead. You can replace any reference to the discipline&#39;s secondary ability with the secondary ability linked to your talent (see below).  </p>
<p><strong>Class Disciplines:</strong> Spells of Ice and Fire, Cup of Brimstone, Puppeteer’s String.  </p>
<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>
<p>You belong to a particular school of magic. Choose one at character creation. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conjurer:</strong> When an encounter ends and you have one or more daily powers with the Summon keyword still active, those daily powers are not expended. However, if you use them again, the summoned creatures appear in the exact state they were when their last summoning ended (current HP, conditions, etc.) except that they can use their encounter powers again even if already used before. If you complete a long rest, all your daily powers reset and if you use them from then on a “fresh” creature will be summoned. Your secondary ability is Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Enchanter:</strong> When you use a power with the Psychic tag that does damage on a hit, you can choose for the power to do no damage to any enemies you target. If so, you gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll. Your secondary ability is Charisma. </li>
<li><strong>Evoker:</strong> If you wish, a near or far power you use with the Acid, Cold, Fire, Flux, Lightning or Thunder tags has its area increased by 1 (from Near arc 2 to Near arc 3, for example). Also, you can change your flux energy as a swift action (see the Elemental Flux discipline for a description of flux energy). Your secondary ability is Dexterity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arcane-strength">Arcane Strength</h3>
<p>Choose either Arcane Overflow or Arcane Sustenance. </p>
<p><strong>Arcane Overflow:</strong> Encounter attack powers from your class disciplines gain the following Miss entry if they do not have one:</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage, and if a hit would have imposed a condition, the target experiences the following (same duration). </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blinded:</em> The target is rattled.</li>
<li><em>Controlled:</em> The target is dazed.</li>
<li><em>Immobile:</em> The target is slowed.</li>
<li><em>Persistent damage 10 or more:</em> Persistent damage 5.</li>
<li><em>Stunned:</em> The target is dazed.</li>
<li><em>Weakened:</em> The target suffers a -4 penalty to damage.</li>
<li><em>Unwilling movement 3 or more:</em> Unwilling movement of the same variety 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arcane Sustenance:</strong> At the start of each of your turns, choose one power you have active that requires an action to Maintain or choose a companion of yours (a summon, familiar, etc.).</p>
<p>If you choose the Maintain power, the power is Maintained as if you spent the relevant action on it. If you choose the creature, it can take an action of your choice without you spending an action on it. This does not allow it to exceed its total actions, so for example if you choose for it to take a standard action, you cannot also spend your standard action to have it take another standard action.  </p>
