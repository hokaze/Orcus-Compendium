<h3>Tradition</h3>
<p>Each class has one or more traditions, which summarize where that class draws most of its power from.   </p>
<p><strong>Arcane:</strong> The practitioners of the arcane tradition seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. If your power comes from arcane magic, it is studied or learned.   </p>
<p><strong>Divine:</strong> The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. If your power comes from divine magic, it is granted by the gods, saints, or other higher powers.   </p>
<p><strong>Martial:</strong> Your power comes from skill at arms, experience in battle, force of will, and training. Martial adventurers have extraordinary abilities, but they are grounded in what is humanly possible.   </p>
<p><strong>Phrenic:</strong> The strength of psyche and emotions. The phrenic tradition represents the power inherent in all sentient beings, the ability to draw forth the spark of life, that inner fire which gives strength to convictions. In some, it takes the form of extreme dedication, unusual courage, or an unbreakable discipline. But in others, it takes on physical form. Their font of power is so great that they can manipulate the world around them by using it. There are currently no classes of the phrenic tradition, but there are kits and feats that give phrenic powers.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit:</strong> An instinctual connection to  and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the spirit tradition. If your power comes from the spirit tradition, it is drawn from the natural world or the spirits of the world.   </p>
