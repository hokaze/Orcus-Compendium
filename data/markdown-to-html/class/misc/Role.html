<h3>Role</h3>
<p>Each class has one or two roles, which summarize how the class most often contributes in combat.  </p>
<p><strong>Defender:</strong> A defender soaks up attacks and damage from enemies, punishes enemies for attacking their allies <em>and</em> punishes enemies for attacking the defender. The defender forces enemies to make difficult decisions or puts them in a “catch-22”.  </p>
<p>Often, defenders control enemies by “marking” them. See the marked condition in the Conditions chapter for more details. </p>
<p><strong>Striker:</strong> A striker does the most damage or otherwise puts enemies out of action, particularly if they are supported by their allies – but they can be vulnerable if they are left exposed.   </p>
<p><strong>Leader:</strong> A leader helps their allies do their jobs better in combat, by keeping them alive through healing and defensive bonuses, by increasing their damage output or other contributions, and by enabling them to do things that they couldn’t do before (even if that is as simple as helping them get into position for an attack).  </p>
<p><strong>Controller:</strong> A controller gives the team control over the battlefield, with crowd control attacks, area denial or impeded movement that limits where and how enemies can move, and negative conditions that reduce what the enemies can do or how effectively they do it.    </p>
