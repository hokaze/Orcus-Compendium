<h2>Spells of Ice and Fire</h2>
<p><strong>Key Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br />
<strong>Secondary Ability:</strong> Intelligence<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Magician (class)</p>
<p>You control elemental ice and fire.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux tag have that energy as a tag, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. </p>
<p>When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it. </p>
<p>Note that the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline is dedicated to the cold and fire flux energies. You can use these powers while you have a different flux energy active, but you don’t get any of the special “Cold” or “Fire” riders.  </p>
