<h2>Rapier’s Point</h2>
<p><strong>Key Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br />
<strong>Secondary Ability:</strong> Charisma<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Exemplar (class)</p>
<p>You are a graceful, skilled duelist.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Other than the powers of the Rapier’s Point and Blades in the Dark Discipline, the main ways to gain momentum are the features of the Exemplar class. Powers that involve momentum may be of limited use to non-Exemplars. </p>
<p>If you do gain momentum from a power, the same rule for losing momentum applies as for the Exemplar: you lose it if you are hit by any attack.  </p>
