<h2>Baldanar</h2>
<p><strong>Medium shadow humanoid (shapechanger)</strong>  </p>
<p>The baldanar are shapeshifters from the Plane of Shadow. In their true form, a baldanar is a grey-skinned humanoid with shallow features and all-black eyes. Planar gossip suggests that the baldanar are the exiled remnants of a mighty terrestrial empire, stripped of their identities as punishment for their hubris. Some baldanar share this belief, and are trying to recover their memories – and their past glory. Others use their ability to shift forms to make something new of their mysterious lives.</p>
