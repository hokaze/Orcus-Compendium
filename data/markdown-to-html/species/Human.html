<h2>Human</h2>
<p><strong>Medium natural humanoid</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to make generalizations about humans.  </p>
<p>Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall.   </p>
<p>Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Giant curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.  </p>

<h3>Variant: True Grit</h3>
<p>Instead of giving humans the Dabbler feature, GMs may want to offer them the <em>true grit</em> power instead â€“ especially if they are taking a class that does not have at-will attack powers. However, GMs should note that <em>true grit</em> is unusually powerful for an ancestry power and it overlaps with the elf's <em>careful focus</em> power.  </p>
