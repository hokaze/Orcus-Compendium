<h2>Grynloc</h2>
<p><strong>Medium natural humanoid</strong>  </p>
<p>Grynlocs are seven-foot tall, lanky hairless humanoids with legs that bend backwards, like a horse's. Their long, toothy mouths make them look a little like camels. They are nomadic desert-dwellers who can literally see magic instead of light when they lower a special lid across their eyes. </p>
<p>Their ability to shape magic allows them to write messages invisible to the naked eye and craft beautiful raiments of pure magic that require special sight or a <em>detect magic</em> invocation to see.  </p>
