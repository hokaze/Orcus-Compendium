# Orcus-Compendium
Searchable online compendium for the Orcus retroclone of 4e.

Currently a very early proof-of-concept and a side project to learn a little html, css and js along the way.

Compendium is licensed under the MIT, but resources taken from the Orcus SRD (https://github.com/Sanglorian/orcus) fall under the OGL v1.0a
